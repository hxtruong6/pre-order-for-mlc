# Pre-Order for Multi-label Classification

This project is a collection of Python scripts for machine learning tasks, specifically focusing on multi-label classification problems. It includes implementations of various predictors and pairwise classifiers.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- scipy
- pandas
- sklearn

You can install these using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy scipy pandas sklearn
```

### Running the Scripts

The main scripts in this project are:

- [`main.py`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22main.py%22%5D "main.py")

You can run these scripts from the command line as follows:

```sh
python main.py
```

## Code Structure

The project includes the following classes.
These classes implement various prediction algorithms and evaluation metrics.

## Datasets

The scripts use datasets in ARFF format. The datasets should be placed in the [`./data/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22.%2Fdata%2F%22%5D "./data/") directory. The scripts are currently configured to use the following datasets:

- emotions.arff
- scene.arff
- CHD_49.arff
- Yeast.arff
- Water-quality.arff
